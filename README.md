# [🍃Game inspired by Flappy Bird 🪶](https://coming.soon)

I was missing developing games and I thought, why not create a game inspired by Flappy Bird?

<h2>Basic Thought</h2>

For me to start producing this game, I first studied the movement of the character. it was a solid move that just consisted of jumping and objects (columns) coming towards you.

<h2>Ideas For The Game</h2>

In my ideas, I thought of developing a boss that forced you to turn your phone screen and throw objects in different directions.<br>
I have no idea how to force someone to turn their phone screen to continue the game but I'll learn.
